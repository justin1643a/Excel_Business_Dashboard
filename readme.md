# Excel Business Dashboard


### Tools Used: Excel
### Type: Excel-Based Reporting & Analytics
### Project Type: Personal, Excel

SQL Skills Used: Importing and transforming data, merging and appending tables, cleaning and shaping data (removing nulls, changing data types, trimming fields), building PivotCharts for dynamic reporting, creating calculated columns and measures, applying conditional logic with formulas ( IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH), and developing KPI visuals.	
## Overview
This dashboard merges WMS shipping data with UPS inbound data to provide a monthly snapshot for leadership review. Since the existing systems did not provide access to open databases, the solution was built entirely in Excel and designed to be user-friendly and maintainable by someone with average Excel experience.


Data Source: This project was inspired by a real-world business challenge. To replicate the scenario, I used AI to help generate a Python script that produces realistic sample data. The dataset was then cleaned and refined to reflect meaningful trends for analysis and visualization..
